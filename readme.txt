This plugin allows users to be "loaded" with training credits. 

All courses using this enrollment method will be available for self
enrolmenet to students still having credits within their account.

Enrolling in course will count down credits from the account.
All credit burning are logged into an additional table.

The plugin provides a cross-module API to load account with credits
from an external module, say, f.e. Moodle courseshop.

Quantified credits. 

Courses that are using this enrollment method can tell the plugin
how many credits can be burn using the standard "course amount" 
information.
